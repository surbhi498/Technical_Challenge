# üéôÔ∏è Spoken Digit Recognition (0‚Äì9) ‚Äì Lightweight Prototype

This project implements a **fast, lightweight** machine learning pipeline for recognizing **spoken digits (0‚Äì9)** from audio.  
It uses **Log-Mel Spectrogram features** + **Logistic Regression** and can work on pre-recorded `.wav` files or live microphone input.

## üìå Features

- **Feature extraction**: Compact log-mel spectrogram + delta features (‚âà120 dimensions).
- **Classifier**: Logistic Regression for speed & simplicity.
- **Cross-validation**: Evaluates performance on training set.
- **Generalization test**: Uses a separate test split.
- **Optional microphone mode**: Live speech recognition.
- **Lightweight**: Trains in seconds, minimal dependencies.

## üìÇ Dataset

This project uses the [Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/free-spoken-digit-dataset),  
accessed from the HuggingFace dataset repository:

- Train split:  
  `hf://datasets/mteb/free-spoken-digit-dataset/data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet`
- Test split:  
  `hf://datasets/mteb/free-spoken-digit-dataset/data/test-00000-of-00001.parquet`

Model Evaluation
This project tackles spoken digit recognition (0‚Äì9) using lightweight audio features and a fast, interpretable model.
The dataset is Free Spoken Digit Dataset, split into training and test sets.

‚öôÔ∏è Modeling Choices
Features: Log-Mel spectrogram statistics (mean, std, delta), ~120 dimensions per clip ‚Üí efficient, low-latency input.

Model: Logistic Regression with L2 regularization ‚Äî minimal computational footprint, ideal for rapid prototyping.

Why it works: Spoken digits have consistent phonetic patterns; compact spectral features + linear classifier capture these effectively.
